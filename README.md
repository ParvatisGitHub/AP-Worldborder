# AP-Worldborder
Adds worldborder wrapping functionality to movecraft ships and crafts

In the config choose between rectangular or circular world borders, the size of the border and where it's centered in the world.
Can change how far a craft is pushed back when it hits your world border with pushback distance.
Can change if world wrapping is enabled and if you want it enabled for x axis, z axis or both.
Can change the cooldown time for crossing the worldborder when wrapping is on and the cooldown message

Intended to be used along side other worldborder plugins as on its own this doesnt stop players from hopping out of the craft and crossing the world border on foot. For best use set the movecraft worldborder a little bit before the world border for the player to ensure pilots arnt stopped from moving or teleported out of their craft.
